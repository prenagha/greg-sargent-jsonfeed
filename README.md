# Daily Blast, Greg Sargent, DSR Network JSON (RSS) Feed

Given a paid private DSR network RSS feed, 
filter out and include only Daily Blast podcasts, 
and return those in JSON Feed format.

The script can be easily deployed as an AWS lambda. 
It formats the data into a [json feed](https://www.jsonfeed.org) which can be read by a podcast client.
